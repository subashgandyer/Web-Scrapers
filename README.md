## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a set of Google Image Scrapers and Web Scrapers for websites like Zomato, Yelp, Foursquare and Burrp.

## Description

For a Computer Vision problem like Object Classification/Detection, getting data is the most crucial part of the process of any Data Scientist. To ease this step, I tried my hands on acquiring images from Google Images using Python scripts that crawls and stores the images locally that I specify. Also, web scrapers are written for food websites like Zomato, Yelp, Foursquare and Burrp to collect information about restaurants, dishes, amenities, user ratings and so on.

## Input & Output

Input:  Website links and some metadata about the site

Output: Images from Google Images and Website information from urls

## Tools Used

* Python

* Selenium Web Driver
